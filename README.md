# Data Visualization of City Economy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing urban data to provide insights into a city's economic trends. By leveraging machine learning models and data visualization techniques, it aims to aid decision-making for city planning, resource allocation, and economic forecasting.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A web-based visualization tool built with Streamlit.
- **Data Analysis**: Uses Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicts financial trends using Random Forest Regression and Classification.
- **Data Visualization**: Implements Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for insightful graphical representations.
- **Smart City Insights**: Helps in identifying financial stability, expenses, wages, and trends for future planning.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Streamlit
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code

## Installation
